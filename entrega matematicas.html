    <h1>BIOGRAPHY OF JOHANN HEINRICH LAMBERT</h1>
    <p>
        He was Born in Mulhouse, France (then a free imperial city).<br>
        He had a modest upbringing and left school at the age of 12.<br>
        He was completely self-taught, learning through reading and work.<br>
        He traveled through Europe as a private tutor before joining the Prussian Academy of Sciences in 1764.<br>

    <h2>MAJOR CONTRIBUTIONS</h2>
    <p>
        01 He Provided the first rigorous proof that π (pi) is irrational.<br>
        02 He Introduced hyperbolic functions into trigonometry<br>
        03 He Founded photometry with his work Photometria (1760).<br>
        04 He Developed Lambert’s Cosine Law for light reflection.<br>
        05 The luminance unit “lambert” is named after him.<br>
    </p>

    <h2>CARTOGRAPHY AND ASTRONOMY</h2>
    <p>
        He studied the mathematical properties of map projections.<br>
        He Proved that angle preservation and equal-area preservation cannot coexist.<br>
        Created the Lambert Conformal Conic Projection, still used today.<br>
        He studied the structure of the Milky Way and formulated Lambert’s Problem in astrodynamics.<br>

    <h2>KEY WORKS</h2>
    <p>
        01. Photometria (1760) Foundation of the measurement of light and brightness.<br>
        02. Anlage zur Architectonic (1771) Analysis of logic and the structure of human knowledge.<br>
        03. Theorie der Parallellinien (1766) Study of Euclid’s fifth postulate; anticipated ideas of non-Euclidean
        geometry.<br>
        04. Beiträge zur Optik (1774) Research on light, color, and vision; expanded his photometric theories.<br>
    </p>

    <h2>RECOGNITION AND LEGACY</h2>
    <p>
        Considered an Enlightenment polymath who united science, mathematics, and philosophy.<br>
        His laws and projections remain essential in modern science.<br>
        His self-taught brilliance continues to inspire scientists and thinkers today.<br>
    </p>

    <h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
    <p>
        Johann Heinrich Lambert was a true Enlightenment genius, a self-taught thinker who connected mathematics, light,
        and philosophy.<br>
        His discoveries shaped modern science, from geometry and optics to astronomy, and his ideas about knowledge and
        truth still inspire scientists and philosophers today.<br>
